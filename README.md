# Minecraft Server Bot

## Using the python virtual environment and installing dependencies

(Most of this is stolen from the python docs)

To create a virtual environment, pick a directory (like in hidden folder called .venv), and run the venv module as a script with the directory path:

`python3 -m venv minecraft-bot-venv`

Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.

On Windows, run:

`minecraft-bot-env\Scripts\activate.bat`

On Unix or MacOS, run:

`source minecraft-bot-env/bin/activate`

Then install dependencies with:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
